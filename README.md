# AI-Powered Merchant Categorization System 🤖💳

Welcome to the **Merchant Categorization** repository! This cutting-edge system utilizes a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and clustering techniques to categorize merchants based on transactional data. Let's dive into the details and explore the fascinating capabilities of this AI-powered system.

## Overview ℹ️

The **Merchant Categorization** repository is designed to revolutionize the way merchants are categorized in the financial industry. By leveraging advanced techniques such as cosine distance calculation, dimensionality reduction using PCA, FastText embeddings, and clustering algorithms like k-means and HDBSCAN, this system offers unparalleled accuracy and efficiency in merchant categorization.

## Key Features 🔑

🚀 **NLP Integration:** Harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing for in-depth merchant analysis  
📊 **Dimensionality Reduction:** Utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for reducing feature dimensions  
🔍 **FastText Embeddings:** Employs FastText word embeddings to represent text data in a high-dimensional vector space  
📈 **Clustering Algorithms:** Implements k-means and HDBSCAN clustering for grouping merchants into distinct categories  
🌌 **Visualizations:** Uses Seaborn plots, silhouette scores, UMAP, and word cloud visualization for intuitive insights
